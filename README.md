Hello, so, im guessing you are wondering what this is. Probably pretty accurate.
WinLua is a lua API/class I made, that uses WinApi to create windows/internal GUIs
with Lua. This allows for easy easy implementation of guis, and modifying them to
a users liking.

Pardon the mess, I was a lot younger when I developed this. I didn't change it after it worked.
This can be capable of being within a DLL, thats what I originally did for it.
